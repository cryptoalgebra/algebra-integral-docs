# Specification and description of contracts

The current specification of smart contracts and external functions of the Core part can be found in [the Algebra Integral protocol repository](https://github.com/cryptoalgebra/Algebra/tree/dev/docs/Contracts/Core). This specification is generated automatically using natspec annotations of functions and state variables of smart contracts.

A conceptual, higher-level description of the Core part logic can be found in [the corresponding section of this documentation](broken-reference).
